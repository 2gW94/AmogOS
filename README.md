## General Info:  

AmogOS is a meme OS based on the hit game Among Us, in the same vain as Hannah Montana Linux, but it's also developed and made to be a highly efficient, modular and useable Operating System that can be ran in a production environment. It is extendable via SLAX modules, and is soon planned to include a modular system security update scheme.

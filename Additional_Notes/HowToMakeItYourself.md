This file talks about what software AmogOS uses

# RPI
The RPI version of AmogOS is made with a RPI OS lite base. It uses Openbox for the WM and LXDE for the DE. From there, the papyrus theme was used to make everything grey. Alot of apps are preinstalled, as detailed in the features section on readme. The os is packaged up with image-utils by ronr and made into the final xz with pishrink.
